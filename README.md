### ‚Ä¢ Game Update 7.6 broke our Character Assembler. [We have a solution in Beta](https://github.com/SWTOR-Slicers/ZG-SWTOR-Tools/releases/tag/2.0.5-beta).

  Depending on which resources folder is selected in the add-on's Preferences (extracted before or after Game Update 7.6), the tool gets the correct classic or modernized results. Check the release's description for details.

### ‚Ä¢ Blender 4.3 breaks our SWTOR materials-processing tools! Stay on 4.2 or older.
That said, **you can open 4.2 projects in 4.3** and the existing SWTOR materials will work (you can install as many versions of Blender you want at once and have them coexist without tripping each other).


### ‚Ä¢ New tool: [ExtracTOR](https://github.com/SWTOR-Slicers/WikiPedia/wiki/Installing-Slicers-GUI-and-extracting-SWTOR-game-assets).
 **Meant to replace Slicers GUI**, it's a pure game assets extractor app by fellow slicer **[UltimaKaosXIII](https://github.com/UltimaKaosXIII)** that spares us the complications of the former tool. **You can take advantage of it already while we update these guides**.

# Welcome to the SWTOR Slicers wiki!

We are a group of swtor fans who enjoy messing with the game and pulling out models, textures, etc. This GitHub repository contains tools and guides to help you do so yourself, as well as some other things.

In this Wiki we pool all the knowledge we are gathering on SWTOR's data and how to use it, be it to discover what Broadsword is cooking (datamining), to enhance our SWTOR experience by changing the game's looks (modding, sadly on hiatus at the moment as the tools need upgrading), or to make art out of the game's assets and immortalize our player characters through other 3D apps or even 3D-printing (extracting). Bear with us: it's far easier than it looks üôÇ.

We encourage you to join our [**SWTOR Slicers Discord Server**](https://discord.gg/XfHFjSN), where you will be able to interact with fellow hobbyists in a direct manner, find help if you get stuck, and even contribute if you feel like it.

(You can find a few of us in the popular **SWTOR Artists Discord Server**'s 3d art channels, too)

### MODDING
**Modding isn't working since SWTOR moved to 64-bit codebase. Unless a new coder takes charge, it'll stay so indefinitely.**
* Alternative techniques:
  * [Modding SWTOR textures with Special K](https://github.com/SWTOR-Slicers/WikiPedia/wiki/Modding-SWTOR-textures-with-Special-K) **(USE CAUTION)**.

***

### DATAMINING
Basically, use **[Jedipedia.net](https://github.com/SWTOR-Slicers/WikiPedia/wiki/JediPedia)**'s tools and check our **[Discord](https://discord.gg/XfHFjSN)**. We'll see about adding new material, but this is very involved stuff.
