* ### We are now compatible with Blender 4.3 and higher.
* ### We have a workable solution to using SWTOR Game Update 7.6' new modernized skin materials. Please update both the .gr2 Importer and the ZG SWTOR Tools Add-ons.
* ### TORCommunity.com's Character Designer doesn't support selecting the new skin colors available with Game Update 7.7 or higher. That said, the colors can be recreated with our materials' Hue-Saturation-Brightness-Contrast controls, after the character has been assembled.

# Welcome to the SWTOR Slicers wiki!

We are a group of swtor fans who enjoy messing with the game and pulling out models, textures, etc. This GitHub repository contains tools and guides to help you do so yourself, as well as some other things.

In this Wiki we pool all the knowledge we are gathering on SWTOR's data and how to use it, be it to discover what Broadsword is cooking (datamining), to enhance our SWTOR experience by changing the game's looks (modding, sadly on hiatus at the moment as the tools need upgrading), or to make art out of the game's assets and immortalize our player characters through other 3D apps or even 3D-printing (extracting). Bear with us: it's far easier than it looks ðŸ™‚.

We encourage you to join our [**SWTOR Slicers Discord Server**](https://discord.gg/XfHFjSN), where you will be able to interact with fellow hobbyists in a direct manner, find help if you get stuck, and even contribute if you feel like it.

(You can find a few of us in the popular **SWTOR Artists Discord Server**'s 3d art channels, too)
