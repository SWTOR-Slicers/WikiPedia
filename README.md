Change Log:

3 Dic, 2021
*  **Added news of the new Blender 3.0 compatible version of the .gr2 add-on.**

10 Nov, 2021
* **Added a "Highlights" section at the beginning** to make some of the most sought after topics more visible. Still, the wiki's index and structure seems to need a less orderly and more to-the-point structure ðŸ¤”.

*  **Added Kunitsa's texture upscaling guide**.

19 Aug, 2021
*  **Updated the screencaps of the Slicer GUI** to reflect the additions to its UI. **Added mentions to the Alien Heads Mod in its installation guide** to help newcomers led there by that mod's instructions.

8 Jul, 2021
*  The **Slicers GUI** tool seems to work well enough to promote it as a replacement to EasyMYP for game asset extractiions, so, the wiki pages have been updated to reflect that.

27 Jun, 2021
*  **The .gr2 Import/Export add-on is now compatible with Blender 2.93**. All compatibility warnings in the wiki have been retired.
